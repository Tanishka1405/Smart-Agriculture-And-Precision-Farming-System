1. Introduction
In recent years, the agricultural industry has experienced a technological revolution, transforming traditional farming methods into highly optimized and data-driven processes through Smart Agriculture and Precision Farming Systems. These advanced systems leverage IoT devices, machine learning, and data analytics to monitor crops, soil, and environmental factors, enabling farmers to make informed decisions to improve crop yields, reduce resource consumption, and enhance sustainability.
This project aims to develop a CI/CD pipeline to support a TypeScript-based application for managing IoT devices in a precision farming setup. The system will include real-time monitoring of soil moisture, weather predictions, automated irrigation, and data analysis for yield predictions.

  Business Object Identifaction
1.	Object/Class: Represents key components in the system (e.g., Farmer, Mobile App, Edge Device).
2.	Attributes: The properties associated with each class, such as IDs, states, or collected data.
3.	Methods: Functions each class can perform, describing their behavior (e.g., collectData(), sendCommand()).
4.	Responsibilities: Defines the role of each object in the system, explaining what it manages or controls (e.g., the Mobile App sends commands to Edge Devices).
5.	Relationships: Outlines the connections between objects, such as communication or associations (e.g., the Edge Device communicates with the Mobile App).

   Intraction of Key Classes:
•	Farmer: Uses the Mobile App to control farm operations, access real-time sensor data, and receive recommendations from the Agronomist.
•	Mobile App: Acts as the user interface for the farmer and processes local data from the Edge Devices.
•	Edge Device: Processes data from sensors and transmits it to the Mobile App for control decisions, reducing the load on the central server.
•	Sensor: Collects data on environmental conditions such as soil moisture and temperature, essential for decision-making in the system.
•	Irrigation System: Automatically adjusts water flow based on sensor readings, ensuring optimal irrigation.
•	Agronomist: Provides expert recommendations based on the analyzed sensor data stored in the Central Server.
•	Central Server: Acts as a data repository for all farm-related information, processing it and forwarding insights to both the Agronomist and the Supply Chain Manager.
•	Supply Chain Manager: Manages inventory and optimizes distribution plans based on processed data from the Central Server.
