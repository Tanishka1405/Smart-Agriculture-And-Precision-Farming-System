# Smart-Agriculture-And-Precision-Farming-System

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, the agricultural industry has experienced a technological revolution, transforming traditional farming methods into highly optimized and data-driven processes through Smart Agriculture and Precision Farming Systems. These advanced systems leverage IoT devices, machine learning, and data analytics to monitor crops, soil, and environmental factors, enabling farmers to make informed decisions to improve crop yields, reduce resource consumption, and enhance sustainability.
This project aims to develop a CI/CD pipeline to support a TypeScript-based application for managing IoT devices in a precision farming setup. The system will include real-time monitoring of soil moisture, weather predictions, automated irrigation, and data analysis for yield predictions.

### 4.1 Explanation of the Business Objects Identification
-	Object/Class: Represents key components in the system (e.g., Farmer, Mobile App, Edge Device).
-	Attributes: The properties associated with each class, such as IDs, states, or collected data.
- Methods: Functions each class can perform, describing their behavior (e.g., collectData(), sendCommand()).
- Responsibilities: Defines the role of each object in the system, explaining what it manages or controls (e.g., the Mobile App sends commands to Edge Devices).
-	Relationships: Outlines the connections between objects, such as communication or associations (e.g., the Edge Device communicates with the Mobile App).
### 4.2 Interaction of Key Classes:
- Farmer: Uses the Mobile App to control farm operations, access real-time sensor data, and receive recommendations from the Agronomist.
-	Mobile App: Acts as the user interface for the farmer and processes local data from the Edge Devices.
-	Edge Device: Processes data from sensors and transmits it to the Mobile App for control decisions, reducing the load on the central server.
-	Sensor: Collects data on environmental conditions such as soil moisture and temperature, essential for decision-making in the system.
-	Irrigation System: Automatically adjusts water flow based on sensor readings, ensuring optimal irrigation.
-	Agronomist: Provides expert recommendations based on the analyzed sensor data stored in the Central Server.
-	Central Server: Acts as a data repository for all farm-related information, processing it and forwarding insights to both the Agronomist and the Supply Chain Manager.
-	Supply Chain Manager: Manages inventory and optimizes distribution plans based on processed data from the Central Server.

## 6. TypeScript in the System
### 6.1. TypeScript Basics:
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing and compile-time error checking. It helps in catching potential bugs early during development, improving the stability of the application.

- Types: In TypeScript, data types such as number, string, boolean, and custom types (via interfaces and classes) are explicitly defined, which helps in reducing errors related to incorrect data handling.
- Classes and Interfaces: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making it easier to model the real-world entities in agriculture.
### 6.2. Object-Oriented Modeling with TypeScript:
The Smart Agriculture and Precision Farming System can be built using an object-oriented approach. Various components in the farming ecosystem such as Farm, Sensor, Controller, and Edge Devices are modeled as TypeScript classes with attributes and methods that define their behaviors.

#### Key Entities:
- Farm: A farm consists of multiple IoT devices, such as sensors and controllers. In TypeScript, the Farm class manages these devices and interacts with other entities like the Farmer and Agronomist.
- Sensor: Sensors collect data such as soil moisture and temperature, modeled using a class that encapsulates sensor-related attributes and methods to retrieve data.
- Controller: The Controller (e.g., irrigation system) adjusts water flow based on sensor data. This is a class that encapsulates control logic and state management (e.g., turning irrigation on/off).
### 6.3. Farm Management Services:
In a precision farming system, Farm Management Services play a crucial role in managing the farms, sensors, controllers, and associated data. These services, implemented in TypeScript, provide a high-level abstraction for handling farm operations, including data collection, decision-making, and control systems.

The service interacts with:

- Mobile App: A farmer uses a mobile app to access real-time data and send commands to control irrigation and other farming operations.
- Edge Device: A device that collects data from multiple sensors, processes it locally, and sends it to the central system for further analysis.
- Irrigation System: A controller that adjusts the water flow based on data received from the system.

### 6.4. Centralized Data Processing and Automation:
The Central Server stores data collected from various IoT devices, processes it, and provides insights into farming activities. This data includes sensor readings, irrigation statuses, weather predictions, and yield forecasts. The Agronomist class analyzes this data to provide expert recommendations to farmers.

### 6.5. Supply Chain Management:
A Supply Chain Manager tracks inventory, monitors farm product availability, and optimizes the distribution of resources like fertilizers and seeds. This is crucial for ensuring that resources are distributed efficiently across multiple farms.
